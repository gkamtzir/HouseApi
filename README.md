# HouseApi

This repo consists of the backend codebase I'm developing for the 3rd deliverable of a 3 part exercice for the course of Databases. This course is part of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering undergraduate program at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

## Technical Notes
The 'House' API is a RESTful API which is built using Python 3 and Flask Microframework. It makes use of the Flask-RESTful extension, which helps build more organized and structured APIs, and the SQLAlchemy toolkit as the Object Relational Mapper.

### Installation Guide
